Experimental infrastructure for building financial market systems.

This repository explores the engineering foundations required for high-frequency and quantitative trading infrastructure.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To understand and implement the internal mechanics of financial systems at the infrastructure level.

This is NOT strategy research.

This is system-level engineering.

---

## 🔬 Modules (Planned)

- Event bus simulation
- Order book engine
- Matching engine fundamentals
- Trade execution pipeline
- Time-series storage models
- Event replay system
- Idempotent event processing
- Throughput benchmarking

---

## 🧠 Engineering Focus

- Low-latency processing
- Memory efficiency
- Lock-free data structures (future)
- Event streaming
- Deterministic replay
- Performance benchmarking

---

## ⚙️ Tools

- C# / .NET
- BenchmarkDotNet
- In-memory event store
- SQL/Time-series storage experiments

---

## 📈 Objective

To engineer infrastructure capable of handling:

- High message throughput
- Deterministic state transitions
- Event consistency
- Replayable systems
